# enigmaSpace

This is a maze app built using vanilla JavaScript. It generates a random maze and allows the user to navigate through it using the arrow keys. The goal is to reach nexus.

##  Setup
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/colson0x1/enigmaspace.git

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser with live server.

## How to Play

- Use the **W** key to move up.
- Use the **A** key to move left.
- Use the **S** key to move down.
- Use the **D** key to move right.

Try to reach the green nexus without hitting the red walls. If the meteor collides with the nexus, the game will end and the walls will fall.
